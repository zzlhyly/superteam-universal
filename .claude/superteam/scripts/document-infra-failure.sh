## Failure Description

[Describe the infrastructure failure: what happened, when it started, what error
messages or symptoms were observed.]

## Knowledge Base Search

[Document what you searched for in the knowledge base, global wiki, or external
sources. Include search queries used and what was found (or not found).]

## Remediation Attempts

### Attempt 1
- **What was tried:** [description]
- **Expected outcome:** [what you hoped would happen]
- **Actual outcome:** [what actually happened]
- **Evidence:** [logs, error messages, screenshots]

### Attempt 2
- **What was tried:** [description]
- **Expected outcome:** [what you hoped would happen]
- **Actual outcome:** [what actually happened]
- **Evidence:** [logs, error messages, screenshots]

### Attempt 3
- **What was tried:** [description]
- **Expected outcome:** [what you hoped would happen]
- **Actual outcome:** [what actually happened]
- **Evidence:** [logs, error messages, screenshots]

## Conclusion

[Summary of findings. Was the issue resolved? If not, what is the recommended
escalation path?]
